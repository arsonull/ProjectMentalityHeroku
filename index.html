      <h2>Howdy!</h2>
      <h4>Welcome to my Project portfolio for Project Mentality. This is a project meant to help people empathize with those that have mental illnesses, by getting into their head and getting them in a similar
        situation to think in a similar way. For instance, with the Obsessive Compulsive Disorder level, the player is shown an objective to complete, such as getting dressed after waking up. As they complete the
        objectives shown to them, in the order given, they get points and work towards leaving the house for the day. However, these points are meaningless, as is the order. All that's actually required from the player,
        is to complete the main objectives, and leave the house. But losing all the points you've worked towards and told to start over feels terrible. Just like breaking out of a rigid behaviour from O.C.D. Obviously
        not the same feeling, but the similarity is there to provide a bad sensation mentally to breaking a routine, getting the player to believe they absolutely MUST do those tasks in order, until they realize they
        could just have left after completing those tasks in any order. Thus realizing, they were under a similar thought pattern as those with O.C.D. and can hopefully understand the state of mind they're in.

      <h2>Reason</h2>
      <h4>The reason for this project is to help those around me, and others that come across this kind of project. I've known and have contact with a lot of people that have mental illnesses, and it sucks
        to see them have such little success with personal relationships, just because it's difficult for people to understand them. When my friend is late to hangout because they messed up their routine and had to
        start over several times, I don't hold it against them because I can understand. But to others who don't understand or can't empathize, they're far more likely to take offense and begin distancing themselves.
        I wanted to try and create essentially a tool that would help the people that are friends or know someone with a mental illness or disability, to assist in their ability to understand.

      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <h4>For the objective system, this is all done within a script attached to the player character. In the script, there are two boolean arrays, one for the real objectives, and one for the fake objectives.
        These often relate to each other for checking progress and if things are in order. I did this since the objectives are boolean in nature, and being able to store all of the objectives progress in those arrays
        helped tremendously. The camera and player controls are taken from the first person controls asset provided by Unity. I had to do some tweaking with the collider, speed, controls, and camera for it to work 
        properly in my game however. Most of the assets/models found around the house, including the house itself, are from a asset pack I purchased to have a house I could set up that would look nice. The house came
        in pieces, and I had to decorate everything myself. In future versions, I would like to completely fill the house, every room with decorations and a purpose. The music is royalty free, and I took a snippet 
        that sounded like it would loop well, went into FL-Studio and using the inspect and cut tool, created a looping soundtrack with no obvious cuts. The main menu was more function over form. I created a canvas 
        with several buttons in the form of words. Each would use the Unity Events controller to change the menu or scene in the case of loading a level. I used GitHub Pages for hosting this website along with the 
        game site. I was at first wanting to host on Azure, but my license got used up. I went to AWS next, but same thing there. So I was forced to try other free services, until I learned of the Pages function for 
        GitHub and it worked tremendously well.

      <h2>Future Consideration</h2>
      <h4>There's a lot that I want to add onto this project. I want to add a timer that gets harder and harder to actually leave the house on time while going through objectives in order, as well as add more fake 
        objectives to distract the player. I also want to add animations and time spent on objectives, so it's not just one click and then leave. There's a lot more than pressing a button to taking a shower for 
        instace. Perhaps add minigames to some tasks to up the difficulty. This would all add a much needed sense of urgency to the player. I would like to expand in how many levels there are. I already have ideas for 
        a level about Schizophrenia and ADHD and how I would be able to interpret those into a game. Another pretty big thing I would want to be able to do, is host the game in a way to distribute the local client, 
        instead of force the player to use the bad WebGL embed. WebGL is really cool, and a fantastic tool for 2D games, but for 3D games, especially in this caliber, it's far better to have a local client. Another 
        small addition I'd like to add is sound effects for the tasks as well.

      <h2>How to Run</h2>
      <h4>
        Currently, you can click on the "Game" button in the navbar above. This will take you to the WebGL version of the game. However, I very much recommend cloning the repository at https://github.com/arsonull/ProjectMentalityApp
        so that you can download and run a local client instead, for a much better experience. All you should need to do, is download that repository and run the ProjectMentalityApp.exe file. That should boot up the 
        game, and Unity should take care of any required binaries that are required to run the game.
