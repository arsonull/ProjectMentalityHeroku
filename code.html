      <h3>The start method is called before the first frame. There's an Awake method you could do as well, but that is called before objects are placed in the scene. In my Start(), I set the 
        originalPosition Vector3 as the position the player is at, to be able to reset the player's position after leaving through the door. I instantiate some integers as well to keep track
        of info on the game progress. I also set a GameObject array equal to all of the fake objective objects to manipulate them in a later code block. They need to be treated differently
        than the real objectives, as they need to be interactable only when they're a possible objective. And lastly, I call a helper method to set the Fake Objectives, which instantiates 
        the fake objective boolean array, based on the successes.
      </h3>
      <br/>
      <img src="code/FakeObjPassed.jpg">
      <h3>The way I handled objective passing is with two different Objective Passed methods. They are very similar code blocks, and both are handled with a switch block that looks like this.
        There are different ways to do this, but I found it best for me, to use a switch block since I need to change the objective text based on which objective was passed. On each line though, 
        it checks if it was passed in order or not, then either calls the inOrderPass or ObjectiveFailed based on that. The first index for both doesn't work properly in the helper methods, so 
        I created a manual check for both.
      </h3>
      <br/>
      <img src="code/InOrderBlocks.jpg">
      <h3>In those InOrder methods, it increments the next objective int for their respective type, then sets the correct index of the boolean arrays as true, meaning that objective was passed. 
        This is where I set the Reward text that informs the player of their point gain, and updates the score text. Then I use Invoke() to call a helper method that just sets the Reward UI 
        Object as inactive, after the 5 seconds given in the parameters.
      </h3>
      <br/>
      <img src="code/ObjFailed.jpg">
      <h3>In Objective failed, it first sets the fake objectives again, causing them all the be false, resetting progress. But ONLY the fake objectives. I then notify the player through the 
        reward text about the loss of points, and to do the objectives in order. I reset the Objective text, and the next objective ints and invoke the helper method to make the reward text 
        inactive once more. The biggest part to note in this, is that it doesn't touch the progress of the realObjectives boolean array at all.
      </h3>
      <br/>
      <img src="code/Escape.jpg">
      <h3>And the last code block I'll go over is the Escape method. At the very start, it checks if all the real objectives are passed. This helper method does not care about them being in 
        order. Then I increment the successes int to note the player succeeded in leaving again. Reset the fake objectives then set the position of gameObject(The game object this script is 
        attached to, which is the player in this case). I notify the player that it's now the next day, reset the points and next objective ints, then reset each door to be closed, and the 
        state of each objective item.
